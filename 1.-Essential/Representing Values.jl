## we first need to learn how julia represents numbers and vector.
## every value is a result of evaluation of some julia expression 
## here are a few basic example values created by evaluation of literals


## creating values by evaluating literals
1
true
"Hello world!";
1.0
[1, 4, 5]


## checking types of values 

typeof(1)
typeof(0.1)
typeof("Hello world!")
typeof([1, 4, 5])
[1 4 5] == [1, 4, 5]
typeof([1 4 5])
